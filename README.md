# ServerPortals
A TModLoader mod adding portals that can teleport you to multiplayer servers! 

# Getting Started
In order to add portals into your world, you will need a "Spawn-in" plugin such as Cheat Sheet or HERO's Mod.
Once you have the portal in hand, use right-click to edit the server information attached to the portal. Once you're finished, left-click to place the portal!

# Using a Portal
To use a portal, all you have to do is right-click it when it is placed in the world. All portals are saved into your world file and persist through singleplayer and multiplayer.

# Mod Extensions
You can add your own portals utilizing the built-in Api. See https://github.com/xNarnia/ExampleServerPortals for more info!
